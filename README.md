# To-do List Manager 

The To-Do List Manager Application is a simple yet powerful tool that allows users to manage their tasks efficiently. It utilizes a Max Heap data structure to prioritize tasks based on their importance, making sure the most urgent tasks are handled first. The app allows users to add tasks, mark them as completed, remove completed tasks, and display all tasks in order of their priority.

What It Can Do:

1.Add Task: Users can add new tasks to the to-do list by providing a description and priority level. Higher priority tasks are given more weight.

2.Mark Task as Completed: Users can mark a task as completed, which can later be removed from the list.

3.Remove Completed Tasks: The application allows for the removal of all completed tasks from the list, keeping it organized and clutter-free.

4.Display All Tasks: The application displays all tasks in order of priority, ensuring that users can always view their most important tasks at the top.

5.Exit the System:
Users can choose to exit the application at any time, closing the program gracefully.

Why I Made This Application:

I created this application to address the common challenge of managing tasks in an efficient way. As a student and aspiring professional, staying organized and prioritizing my tasks is essential for managing academic and personal responsibilities. This tool not only helps me stay organized but also deepens my understanding of data structures like heaps and their practical applications.
